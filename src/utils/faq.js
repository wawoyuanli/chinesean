      "The time needed for the approval of such an application to a Program varies from Program to Program. First, it depends on whether the Program has opted for Automatic Approval, which means that no manual process will be involved. It will just take less than a minute to receive the confirmation. Other Programs which are set for Manual Approval need to go through the Advertiser. The time taken by different Advertisers varies from 1 day to 2 weeks. Some Advertisers may not reject websites right away during their screening process, to make open the option of accepting the website in the future. So if the status remains as “Pending” for over 2 weeks, the chance for it to get approved for a Program is relatively low but there is still a chance for it to get approved in the future.",
